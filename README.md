# Agentic AI for automated model selection and training using tool-calling LLMs 
This project showcases an agentic AI system that uses tool-calling language models to automate machine learning workflow. The system analyzes a CSV dataset, determines if it's a regression or classification task, selects suitable tools, trains multiple models, and returns the best-performing one. Each step is handled by a modular agents that reasons and acts based on the data. Itâ€™s built using LangChain and standard ML libraries.
